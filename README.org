* Configuration Testbed
A place to configuration files in containers, testing the dependencies needed for them to run.

See the [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] for the commands used.

** Packing Pure-Plus packages
1) Build and run container with =make all=
2) Run Emacs =emacs ~/.emacs=
    - Should fail since packages have not been downloaded
3) Download pure packages with =M-x jmn-install-plus-packages=
4) Change to shared volume: =cd /app/output/=
5) Place Elpa packages into the attached volume with Makefile: =make package-elpa=
6) Installing newer emacs versions (28) is also explored with:
    - =make download-rpms=
    -  =make install-rpms=
    -  =make clone-emacs=
    -  =make run-emacs-installer=
    -  =make package-rpms=

** Other tools to bring in/test
*** pandoc
- Download =amd64.tar.gz= version of latest from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases
- untar with =tar -xzvf <name>=
- executable is in the =pandoc/bin=

*** emacs VSCode extension
May need to test these in the future

** Notes
*** Container: z needed at the end of the volume attachment for SELinux
