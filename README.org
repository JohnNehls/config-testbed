* Configuration Testbed
A place to configuration files in containers, testing the dependencies needed for them to run.

See the [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] for the commands used.

** Packing Pure-Plus packages
1) Build and run container with =make all=
2) Run Emacs =emacs ~/.emacs=
    - Should fail since packages have not been downloaded
3) Download pure packages with =M-x jmn-install-plus-packages=
4) Change directory to apps: =cd /app/=
5) Place elpa packages into the attached volume with  =./package_elpa.sh=

** Other tools to bring in/test
*** pandoc
- Download =arm64.tar.gz= version of latest from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases
- untar with =tar -xzvf <name>=
- executable is in the =pandoc/bin=

*** emacs VSCode extension

** Notes
*** z needed at the end of the volume attachment for SELinux
